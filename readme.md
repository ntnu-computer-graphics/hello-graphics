## NTNU Hello Graphics
This repository serves as a quick introduction to html, css and javascript. Here you will find a bare-bones, no thrills template of a typical javscript project.

The project was created with Vite.js, a fast and easy way of bundling and serving web apps.

In order to run the application, run the following steps:

1.  npm install
2.  npm run dev

That's it! 

You're page should open automatically. If not, navigate to 'http://localhost:5173' and you should see the application.
